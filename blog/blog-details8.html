                <p>The JavaScript landscape is constantly evolving, with new frameworks emerging and existing ones gaining popularity. Among the top 10 JS frameworks currently in use, some of the most prominent include:

                    * React: A popular framework for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM.
                    * Vue.js: Another component-based framework, praised for its simplicity and ease of learning.
                    * Angular: A comprehensive framework from Google, offering a full-featured solution for building complex applications.
                    * Svelte: A compiler-based framework that compiles components into highly efficient vanilla JavaScript, known for its performance and simplicity.
                    * Ember.js: A framework that emphasizes convention over configuration, providing a structured approach to building web applications.
                    * Next.js: A React framework that simplifies server-side rendering and static site generation.
                    * Nuxt.js: A Vue.js framework focused on server-side rendering and static site generation.
                    * Gatsby: A static site generator built on React, known for its speed and performance.
                    * Preact: A lightweight alternative to React, offering similar features with a smaller footprint.
                    * Aurelia: A framework that emphasizes modularity and flexibility, allowing developers to choose the components they need.
                    
                    This list is not exhaustive, and the best framework for a particular project will depend on factors such as project requirements, team expertise, and personal preferences.
